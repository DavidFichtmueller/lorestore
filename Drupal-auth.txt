Drupal Authentication
=====================

LoreStore includes code for integrating with user accounts and sessions
from a drupal installation running the AustESE repository code.

This works by calling an XMLRPC function on Drupal. 'check_login'
is called, which accepts a session id parameter, and returns user details
about that session. If it's a valid session, the user is authenticated
for using Lorestore.

This function only responds to calls from localhost.

This authentication method will only work when cookies are shared
between drupal and lorestore.

Requirements
------------
Drupal installation with a recent AustESE repository version.

Configuration
-------------
Edit local-lorestore-substitution.properties adding:

emmet.security=drupal
lorestore.drupalhostname=localhost
lorestore.drupalxmlrpc=http://127.0.0.1/xmlrpc.php
